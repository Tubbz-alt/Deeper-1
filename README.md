# Deeper
A view of the deep learning landscape; implementations of old and new deep learning architectures. I aim to implement state of the art methods in machine learning using the latest implementations of Tensorflow (2.0) or PyTorch. 

## Models Implemneted

### Autoencoders
- VAE
- Gaussian Mixture VAE
    - Marginalised VAE
    - Gumble Softmax discrete sampling
- Gaussian Mixture VAE with GAN Error
    - Gumble softmax discrete sampling
